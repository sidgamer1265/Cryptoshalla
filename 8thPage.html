          1. High volatility and potential for large losses
        </P>

        <P>
          The annualised volatility of the monthly percent change in the
price of bitcoin in US dollars is about 90% as measured over
the past five years. This compares to annualised volatility of
the monthly percent changes in the S&P 500 and the gold
price of 15.3% and 13.4% respectively. To give some idea of
what this volatility might mean for an investor it is useful to
consider the range of returns: the maximum monthly bitcoin
return over the 60 months to end December 2020 was 76.1%
and the minimum -37.6%. In addition it is worth noting that in
12 of those 60 months – 20% of the time – the monthly bitcoin
return was worse than -10%. Whereas the S&P 500 generated
negative returns in 17 of those months, the price of bitcoin fell
in 25.
So investors need to be aware that the potential for large
gains is offset to some extent by the possibility of large
losses – the timing of an investment in bitcoin or other
cryptocurrencies will have a significant bearing on the returns
achieved. Indeed, on 11 January 2021, the UK’s Financial
Conduct Authority issued a statement warning investors in
cryptocurrencies that they should be prepared to lose all
their money given the highly speculative characteristics of
the asset class.5 Days later, ECB President Christine Lagarde
also labelled bitcoin as a speculative asset, calling for central
banks to regulate the cryptocurrency to prevent its use for
money laundering activities.6
 And India recently announced a
plan to ban all private cryptocurrencies.
We further note that not all cryptocurrencies are the
same. Whilst bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies did
indeed perform strongly last year, others did less well. For
example, the cryptocurrency EOS is less well known and less
widely traded than bitcoin but it is relatively large and well
established, being one of the five cryptocurrencies that make
up the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index. In 2019 the USD value
of EOS fell by 1.5% and in 2020 it declined by 0.2%. Crypto
performance can and does vary significantly dependent on
which version is selected.

    2. Correlations
  </P>
          
  
          <P>
            It was previously noted that of the 17 months the S&P 500 fell
            over the five years to end 2021, the price of bitcoin went up in
            seven. An alternative way of saying the same thing is that of
            the 17 months the S&P 500 declined, bitcoin also went down
            in 10 of them, which is slightly less flattering.7
             Of the five worst
            months for the S&P 500 the price of bitcoin declined in four
            of them – one could argue that bitcoin has a poor record of
            providing diversification benefits when they are most needed.
            Moreover, changes in the price of bitcoin are positively
            correlated with changes in the S&P 500 index and to a
            greater extent than gold; the correlation coefficient between
            monthly % changes in the price of bitcoin and the S&P 500
            index is 20.4% over the five years to end December 2020
            whereas the correlation between monthly % changes in
            gold and the S&P 500 is 17.5%. And on a rolling basis there
            are times when the correlations between bitcoin and the
            S&P are even higher (see Figure 5). A final point to highlight
            in this regard is that, as with the returns achieved, the
            impact of owning a cryptocurrency in a portfolio will vary
            enormously dependent on which one is chosen

              3. Endless potential supply
            </P>

                      Whilst it is true that the number of bitcoins produced
                      will eventually be capped at 21 million and many other
                      cryptocurrencies also have limited supply built into their
                      protocols, there is currently nothing to stop an ever-growing
                      number of new cryptocurrencies from being launched.
                      Therefore, cryptocurrency supply is potentially limitless.
                      Bitcoin is currently the favoured cryptocurrency but over time
                      fashions and tastes may change, possibly very quickly and for
                      no apparent reason. It is possible that once the bitcoin supply
limit has been reached this will encourage flows into other
cryptocurrencies, precipitating a fall from favour for bitcoin.
This is not a prediction but merely identification of one way
in which cryptocurrency market dynamics might change. It is
also worth noting that several central banks are exploring the
possibility of launching their own digital currencies, another
potential catatlyst that may take the shine off privatelymanaged versions

                        4. Poor store of value and limited acceptance
                      </P>
                              
                      
                              <P>
                                Whilst bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies are now
accepted across a growing number of payment platforms, the
number of places where one can exchange cryptocurrencies
for real goods or services is very limited. Other perhaps than
in Venezuela, one cannot generally go into a coffee shop or
restaurant (lockdown rules permitting) or other store and
pay using a cryptocurrency – most places would not accept
it. This is not least because cryptocurrencies are so volatilethe revenue will vary wildly when converted back into a
currency in which the merchant usually conducts business.
The challenges here are compounded by the huge amount of
intraday variation . If a lot of people pay using
cryptocurrency this may result in a large mismatch with the
merchant’s cost structure. For similar reasons the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies
makes them a poor store of value. The value of
cryptocurrency savings when converted back into an
individual’s base currency – that in which they conduct most
of their transactions and in which their assets and liablities
are expressed – will swing about wildly even on an intradaybasis. This lack of stability reduces the attractiveness of
cryptocurrencies as a store of wealth.

          5. Unregulated and unbacked                 
               </P>
                                      
                              
   <P>
    Cryptocurrencies are a construct of the private sector
    with no official oversight or regulation. This means that
    cryptocurrencies are wide open to being exploited by
    criminals who in turn are able to use cryptos as a means
    to scam unwary investors. This is no doubt one reason
    why central banks and regulators are keen to get involved.
    There are of course perfectly legitimate ways and means of
    investing in cryptos but the lack of regulation makes them
    an attractive playground for less law-abiding members of
    society. A 2019 academic study found that 25% of bitcoin
    users are involved in illegal activity and that 46% of bitcoin
    transactions are associated with illegal activity.9
    Whilst traditional financial systems and the currencies they
    use are certainly not faultless, they are at least heavily
    regulated. This not only deters criminal activity but it means
    that if there is a problem there are a set of rules (often
    embedded in law) and organisations in place to help deal
    with it. For example, most modern banking systems have
    some sort of deposit insurance in place, while credit and
    debit cards also typically provide a degree of insurance
    against fraudulent activity.
    Furthermore, a country’s own currency has a special status
    as legal tender meaning that a creditor is legally obliged
    to accept it as payment for a debt. This fundamental
    characteristic underpins financial systems, augmented by
    monetary policy rules and trust in elected government.
    In contrast, because cryptocurrencies are not backed by
    anything other than faith in the system, damage to that faith
    will leave the cryptocurrency highly vulnerable.
    There are already, according to Coinopsy, over 1,800
    cryptocurrencies that have failed10 and there are other
    examples in history of private currencies having failed
    when trust was lost. In a 2019 presentation, St. Louis Fed
    President James Bullard noted that in the 1830s 90% of US
    money supply was represented by private currencies; he
    described it as “a state of affairs that has existed historically
    but was disliked and eventually replaced.”11 Markets also lose
    faith in traditional currencies when the monetary systems
    and governments stop functioning properly, such as recently
    occurred in Zimbabwe or Venezuela. However, this is highly
