              Blockchain is a system of recording information that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. In simple words, it is the chain of blocks that contain information. Each block has Data, Hash and Hash of a previous block.
Data stored inside the block depends upon the type of Blockchain.
Hash is the identity of a block and is always unique for every block like the Face ID in our Mobile phones.
The third element in a block is the HASH of the Previous block, which effectively creates a chain of blocks, and this technique is called BLOCKCHAIN.
We can also create new blocks in the Blockchain, and this process is called mining.
After the popularity of Bitcoin, many realised that Blockchain has uses like storing medical kits, creating a digital notary and even collecting taxes.

  Are Blockchain & Cryptocurrency the same?
No, they are not the same.
Blockchain is the technology on which Cryptocurrency works.

          A blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network. Using this technology, participants can confirm transactions without a need for a central clearing authority. Potential applications can include fund transfers, settling trades, voting, and many other issues.

                  A blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network. Using this technology, participaDue to the encryption feature, Blockchain is always secure. The transactions are done instantly and transparently, as the ledger is updated automatically. As it is a decentralized system, no intermediary fee is required. The authenticity of a transaction is verified and confirmed by participants.
 
                  The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain. A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.
                  Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain

                        In the world of Cryptocurrency, a node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network. The node supports the relevant cryptocurrency's network through either; relaying transactions, validation or hosting a copy of the blockchain. In terms of relaying transactions each network computer (node) has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports, when a transaction is made the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction (and every other transaction) is known.
                            Node owners are either volunteers, those hosted by the organisation or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology or those that are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network

                                Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to "prove" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.
                                The first timestamping scheme invented was the proof-of-work scheme. The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt.
                                Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include Crypto Night, Blake, SHA-3, and X11.
                                  The proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there's currently no standard form of it. Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme
