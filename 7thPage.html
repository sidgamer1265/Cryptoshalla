          1. Potential for high returns
        </P>

        <P>
          One of the main arguments in favour of cryptocurrencies is
          the potential for high returns. For example, in the five years
          to 31 December 2020, the S&P 500 index of large cap US
          equities has compounded at an annualised growth rate of
          14.5% (in USD, net dividends reinvested); over the same time
          period the price of bitcoin in USD has compounded at an
          annualised growth rate of 131.5% (see Figure 2). The prospect 
          of high returns becomes even more attractive in the context of
          very low government bond yields. Furthermore, high potential
          returns are appealing for those who believe equity returns will
          be lower for a while following strong performance last year.

    2. Potential diversification
  </P>
          
  
          <P>
            Diversification has also been mentioned as a potential
benefit of investing in cryptocurrencies, with some saying
it is an alternative to gold to use as a hedging tool in a
portfolio context. For example, the S&P 500 declined in 17
out of the 60 months to end December 2020, of which the
price of bitcoin rallied in seven. As noted above, a portfolio
invested entirely in the S&P 500 (in USD, net dividends
reinvested) would have generated compound annual
returns of 14.5% in the five years to end 2020. A portfolio
consisting of 10% invested in bitcoin and 90% in the S&P 500
would have generated compound annual returns of 26.8%.
Moreover, the ratio of the compounded annual return to the
annualised volatility– a simplified information ratio – rises
from 0.95 for the S&P 500 on its own to 1.5 for the portfolio
in which 10% was invested in bitcoin.

            <P> 
              3. Limited supply
            </P>
                    
            
                    <P>
                      A particular feature of bitcoin is that there is a maximum of 21
million coins that can be created or “mined”. At the moment
around 18.5 million bitcoins have been mined (see Figure 3),
leaving less than three million still to come into existence.
A related feature is that the rate of production of bitcoins
slows over time via a process known as halving – every so
often according to pre-determined conditions the number
of bitcoins paid for mining a block halves. Whereas in 2009
each block mined was worth 50 bitcoins, the value is now 6.25
bitcoins per block following the latest halving in May 2020.
Additionally, it is thought that around 20% of existing bitcoin
supply has been lost or is inaccessible as a result of lost
or forgotten passwords.1
 The scarcity of bitcoin adds to its
appeal for some investors – if demand for bitcoin increases
further and supply is capped that would potentially drive the
price higher. More generally, this supply-cap is a feature of
many cryptocurrencies.

                        4. Protection from debased currencies and the threat of
                        rising inflation
                      </P>

                                The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008/09 was a catalyst
                                for central banks around the world to engage in unorthodox
                                monetary policies, notably large scale asset purchases. For
                                example, since the GFC began, the balance sheets of the US
                                Federal Reserve and the ECB have each expanded by over
                                US$6 trillion while the Bank of Japan’s balance sheet has
                                expanded by a little less than US$6 trillion. Proportionately
                                the Fed’s balance sheet has expanded by 8x, the ECB’s by a
                                little under 4x and the BoJ’s by nearly 7x.
                                Some people are concerned this will result in a massive
                                debasing of national currencies, as happened in the Weimar
                                Republic in the 1920s when the mark became worthless.
                                According to people holding these views, bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies offer alternatives that cannot be debased
in the same way, partly because supply is capped and partly
because cryptos are not subject to the same political and
economic pressures as national central banks e.g. central
banks intervening in currency markets (such as the Bank of
Japan and Swiss National Bank), central banks being obliged
to support the economy during times of stress by purchasing
government bonds. A corollary is that proponents of this view
believe cryptocurrencies will provide much better protection
against rising inflation. Such individuals find cryptocurrencies
attractive precisely because they are insulated from
government interference.

          5. Growing acceptance and usage

    As noted in the introduction, a growing number of payment
    platforms are now allowing transactions to take place in
    bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. An article from last year
    claimed that Coinbase had seen $135 billion in cryptocurrency
    merchant transactions in 2019, a 600% increase over 2018.
    That same article cites a Chainalysis report that alleges
    payment processors saw approximately $4 billion worth
    of bitcoin activity in 2019.2
     Furthermore, another article
    quotes survey data that suggests at least a third of US small
    businesses accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.3
    Separately, it is notable that there has been a significant
    increase in the number of bitcoin electronic wallets
    created over the past few years (see Figure 4) although it is
    impossible to know for what purposes they are being used.
    And there are an increasing number of institutional investors
    who are looking to invest in cryptocurrencies, the latest
    being Blackrock and Bridgewater. Grayscale Investments,
    a self-proclaimed “trusted authority in digital currency
    investing”, reported that in 2020, 86% of the $5.7 billion in
