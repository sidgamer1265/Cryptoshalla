Since the crypto market gathered momentum in India, NFTs have been gaining traction amongst the millennials and Gen Z. NFT marketplaces are a great platform for artists to monetize their work. Because the sales of the NFT majorly depend on virality, Indian creators are gaining popularity in the international NFT market as well.
NFTs not only puts the power back in the hands of the artists but these are also considered a tool for artists and creators to engage with their audience and unite them with the power of art.

                  The government is planning to define cryptocurrencies in the new draft bill that also proposes to compartmentalise virtual currencies on the basis of their use cases, three people aware of the development told ET. Cryptocurrencies will be treated as an asset/commodity for all purposes, including taxation and as per user case — payments, investment or utility.
                  This would be the first time cryptocurrencies will be categorised as per the technology they use, but the government’s focus would be based on the end-use of the asset for regulatory purposes, sources said
                  The bill is also expected to outline the tax treatment for such assests,so that it is clearly classified in the books of account
                  Cryptocurrency trading may soon face a tax structure in India as the Ministry of Finance has reportedly formed a new committee to find out if income made by crypto-trading could be taxed. The development comes at a time when the country awaits the announcement of an official Cryptocurrency Bill that will be presented before the Parliament in its upcoming Winter Session. For now, while trading in cryptocurrencies has witnessed momentum in India, the country has no solid laws to regulate it.
                  Four weeks have been granted to this new panel formed by the finance ministry, Inc42 reported on Wednesday, September 22.

                  At the end of the allotted time duration, the panel will have to inform if income made by trading in cryptocurrencies can be taxed as capital gains or they would need to be classified under a newly created tax category.

                      The taxation analysis on cryptocurrency trading-based income by this committee will reportedly be included in the final draft of the Cryptocurrency Bill.

In recent months, the cryptocurrency space in India has witnessed expansion. In India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and Vietnam, the rate of cryptocurrency adoption rose by 880 percent in, as per a report released earlier this month.

According to a report by TechStory, around seven million Indians have invested a collective sum of over $1 billion (roughly Rs. 7,380 crores) in cryptocurrencies.
Amid the growing crypto culture, Indian finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has been overlooking the draft formulation of the Cryptocurrency Bill.

Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is also working on launching its first official digital currency as a regulated “central bank digital currency (CBDC)” by the end of 2021.
After dilly-dallying over legalising or banning cryptocurrencies, the Indian government has taken an encouraging step towards regulating digital currencies in India. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has made it mandatory for companies to disclose crypto trading/investments during the financial year. Experts see it as a positive step and expect the taxation rules to follow through. This is being considered as the first step towards regulating cryptocurrencies in India.

The accounting of crypto assets is aimed at curbing illegal activities and circulation of black money via cryptos. It can also improve corporate governance with more transparent disclosures. The Centre has assured crypto stakeholders that there won't be a blanket ban on digital currencies and that it's still formulating its full opinion on the matter. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said the Centre was open to experimentation with new technologies and is not closing its minds for them.

                          While the government has some reservations regarding cryptocurrencies, it is also working on its digital currency. The government does not want to be left behind in the new age tech revolution and aims to cash in on the benefits blockchain technology offers. "The time has come to leverage its applications while at the same time strengthening the digital infrastructure," Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das had said in February while announcing that RBI is working on its digital currency.
                          Cryptocurrencies are not illegal in India. So if you want to buy, let's say Bitcoins, you can do so and start trading in it. However, India does not have a regulatory framework to govern cryptocurrencies as of now. The government had constituted an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on November 2, 2017, to study virtual currencies. The Group's report, along with a Draft Bill, flagged the positive aspect of distributed-ledger technology and suggested various applications, especially in financial services, for its use in India, including banks and other financial firms.

However, the Centre had flagged reservations around its misuse and wanted to put a blanket ban in India. Latest reports say cryptocurrency may not face a complete ban in India. The Centre may soon set up a panel to regulate them. The decision was taken after several cryptocurrency exchanges urged the Centre to regulate virtual coins rather than banning them.
