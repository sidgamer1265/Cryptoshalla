          Volatility in financial markets refers to changes in the price of an asset. It can be healthy, with steady increases or decreases in price within a general range. It can also be extreme, with sudden price movements in either direction. Healthy volatility serves many purposes in a market, but it mainly creates opportunities for profit. For example, stock price changes enable traders to buy low and sell high, or “short” a stock they expect to decrease in price. Extreme volatility occurs when an asset’s price changes rapidly within a short time.
          Crypto Market Volatility
          Most observers of cryptocurrency markets will agree that crypto volatility is in a different league altogether. There are no indices to measure crypto price volatility, but you just need to glance through historical price charts to see that skyrocketing peaks and depressive troughs occur at a quicker and more extreme pace in crypto prices compared to prices of assets in mainstream markets. In 2016, the price of bitcoin rose by 125% and in 2017 the price rose again, this time by more than 2,000%. Following the 2017 peak that saw it hit new all-time highs, bitcoin’s price receded once more. In 2021, bitcoin continued to set new all-time highs, more than tripling the peak price bitcoin achieved during the 2017 bull run.
          Many of the reasons for price volatility in mainstream markets hold true for cryptocurrencies as well.

              But their effect is exaggerated in crypto markets as they have less liquidity than traditional financial markets — a result of crypto markets lacking a robust ecosystem of institutional investors and large trading firms. Heightened volatility and a lack of liquidity can create a dangerous combination because both feed off of each other. Other than bitcoin, most other cryptocurrencies also lack established and widely adopted derivatives markets. Under the sway of day traders and speculators, crypto prices sometimes exhibit healthy volatility of the type we see in mainstream markets.

              But, there are signs that volatility in crypto markets is turning a corner. Institutional investors and trading firms are beginning to enter the asset class with more conviction, and a derivatives market for cryptocurrencies is also beginning to take shape as part of the development and expansion of the broader crypto market ecosystem.
              
              Whether crypto volatility will eventually mimic volatility patterns present in mainstream assets is still to be determined. But, as the asset class continues to grow and develop, it will likely continue to regularly exhibit outsized volatility until it reaches full maturity at some point in the future.
              News developments and speculation are responsible for fueling price swings in crypto and mainstream markets alike.

               A. Cryptocurrency is still an emerging market
               </P>

                <P>
                  Cryptocurrency is still an emerging market, gaining rapid popularity as well fuelling quick disenchantment among investors. Despite all the media attention, this market is still minuscule when compared to traditional currencies, or even gold. This means even smaller forces – a group of people holding large amounts of crypto coins – can influence the trade. Even if they sell only Bitcoins, it would be enough to crash the whole market.
                  
                  Speculation
                  
                  The cryptocurrency market thrives on speculation. Investors bet that the prices would go up or go down to make profits. These speculative bets cause a sudden influx of money or a sudden outgo, leading to high volatility
                  Despite all of the media attention that cryptocurrencies have had over the years, the size of the market is still minuscule compared to fiat currencies and gold. Even at its peak, the cryptocurrency market was only around $800 billion. That’s loose change compared to the total value of the gold market at $7.9 trillion, and $28 trillion for the United States stock market.

                  This relatively small market size means that smaller forces can have a larger effect on price. If one group of investors decided to sell $500 million in gold, it would barely create a ripple in the price of gold. If the same happened to Bitcoin, it would be enough to destabilize the whole market and crash the price.
                  
                  However, the fact that the cryptocurrency market is still developing also means there are many opportunities to hit it with a new and exciting project. For example, not so long ago the Telegram developers announced the launch of blockchain platform TON and coin Gram. Interestingly, neither of these projects has been completed yet, but news media have already publicized the initiative. So, entering the emerging market is a good way to get your product talked about and, therefore, known and recognized.

                      2. Cryptocurrencies are purely digital
                      </P>
       
                       <P>
                        Most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are purely digital assets and aren’t backed by anything physical like a currency or commodity. That means that their price is set entirely by the laws of supply and demand. Since the supply of many cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is fixed or predictable, the price is dependent on how many people want to buy Bitcoin right now.

                        There is no physical asset to back the value of the major cryptocurrencies or governments to enforce their use as a currency. That means their value is backed entirely by faith. If people no longer believe that the value of Bitcoin will hold or continue to rise, they’ll likely sell. This can reduce the price and convince others to sell too, so a cycle forms and quickly plunges the price downwards. The opposite can also happen to shoot prices up and form over-inflated price bubbles.

                            3. The technology is still developing
                            </P>
             
                             <P>
                              Blockchain and other alternative crypto technologies are still in their early stages of development. It’s barely been a decade since the idea of cryptography-based decentralized currencies was published in the Bitcoin whitepaper, so it will be a while before the market matures. Nevertheless, many companies have already adopted blockchain technology and are actively using it for marketing and advertising purposes. The most promising projects in the sphere are AdEx, Brave, and Steem. Since many customers find transparency and other advantages of blockchain attractive, exploring this technology may be very beneficial in brand marketing.

                              Particularly stubborn technological hurdles like the blockchain scalability problem cause downward pressure on crypto prices when they aren’t solved in the timeframe that many expect. Or, when their consequences get crystallized in the form of network congestion and high transaction prices.
                              
                              On the other hand, pivotal developments in the technology can have a boosting effect. This includes structural progress such as the Bitcoin Lightning Network or new popular applications on blockchain platforms such as Ethereum. There are also lots of new cryptocurrencies popping up all the time looking to compete and take some market share from the established ones.
                             </P>

                                  4. Speculation
                                  </P>
                   
                                   <P>
                                    One of the biggest drivers of volatility in the cryptocurrency market is speculation. This involves investors betting that the price of different cryptocurrencies will go up or down by buying and selling cryptocurrencies. In fact, it is the volatility of the cryptocurrency market that lures speculative traders looking to make big money by guessing the swings.

If you can pick when the price of Bitcoin or XRP will burst upwards and buy right before it does, you can make a killing. Likewise, if you can short sell a cryptocurrency right before it crashes, you can profit too. Many investors are constantly trying to guess the up and down swings of the cryptocurrency market. These speculative bets cause even more volatility in an already choppy market.
